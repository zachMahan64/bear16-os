UNIT TESTS INTENDED FOR TESTING NEW/WIP FEATURES IN ISOLATION

EACH FILE INSIDE THIS DIRECTORY IS INTENDED TO BE ASSEMBLED WITHIN AN ENTRY FILE, SEE BELOW ->

~assemble & run ~
(in this example you would need a debug dir for the debug/test.bin target and you would need to include your unit test file inside the test.asm entry):
b16 -ar test.asm debug/test.bin
